## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- JS vanilla

### What I learned

During this project, I practiced the use of asynchronous functions in JavaScript and API Rest

```js
async function fetchData(url) {
    const response = await fetch(url)
    const data = await response.json();

    return data;
};

async function randomAdvice() {
    const data = await fetchData(URL);

    adviceId.innerText = `ADVICE #${data.slip.id}`;
    adviceContainer.innerText = `"${data.slip.advice}"`;
};
```
